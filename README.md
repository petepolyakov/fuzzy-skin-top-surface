The Fuzzy Skin G-code Processor is a web-based tool designed to modify your 3D printing G-code by applying a “fuzzy skin” effect to the top layers of your model.
This effect is achieved by slightly offsetting the extrusion paths using mathematical functions, simulating a textured, organically altered surface on your print.
The processed G-code is then visualized in a dynamic 3D viewer that renders the toolpaths as extruded tubes-with realistic lighting, shadows, and interactive camera controls-providing a near-real preview of how your modified design will appear when printed.

Possible Usage:
Pre-Print Visualization: Quickly assess and iterate on surface modifications before committing to a print, reducing waste and trial-and-error.

Design Experimentation: Test various fuzzy skin parameters (e.g., amplitude, frequency, top layers) to achieve unique surface textures for artistic or functional purposes.

Quality Assurance: Simulate and inspect how subtle adjustments to extrusion paths affect print quality, helping to identify potential issues early in the design process.

Educational Tool: Serve as a practical example for learning advanced G-code post-processing techniques and understanding the relationship between toolpath modifications and printed outcomes.

This feature is ideal for 3D printing enthusiasts, designers, and engineers looking to innovate, refine, and visualize surface textures and effects directly from their digital models before printing.
